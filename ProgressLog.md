Objectives for this week are to get caught up on what this project is about. Stuff to read on:
- Globular clusters
- Open clusters
- What is a star cluster
- How do we classify star clusters i.e. what features do both of these clusters have?
- How do we create a ML model to classify these?  What features are we looking for?
- Data? Where do we get it? How do we train the AI from this data?

Main goal for this week: Find a good dataset that we can work with.
