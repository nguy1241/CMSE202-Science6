# Collaboration and communication:

Main communication channels will be through discord. 
Meetings outside of class to make sure everyone's on track and answer questions.
Meetings will depend on everyone's availability, online through Zoom or in-person.

Will have deadlines for each part of the project to ensure everyone is on track with meeting. 

Scrum meetings to check progress every week? 

Progress updates on discord/ if you need help with a section, feel free to message on there. 

Goal: To create a script/ program that takes in features of a star cluster (i.e. physical characteristics) and output a classification of star cluster

# Notes for project
- Where do we find data?
- What type of data is suitable/ good data?
- What machine learning model should we use? 
- How do we determine the accuracy of our ML model.

Dataset features:
- Star temp
- Star diameter
- Distance to star
- Wavelength of light emitted of a star
- Class of star cluster
Create notebook and add background info.
